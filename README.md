# RecallHunter

This a chrome extension that appends to an Amazon product page a form that the user can use to search the Consumer Product Safety Commission API for product-recalls.

The user also has the choice to sign up with our service, which allows a user to create a watchlist that will be checked for new recalls at an interval that the user chooses. Moreover, any Amazon purchases the user makes since our extension is used will automatically be added to the watchlist.
