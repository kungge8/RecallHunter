# RecallHunter

This is a chrome extension that appends a form to an Amazon product page. The form allows the user to search the Consumer Product Safety Commission API for product-recalls.

The user also has a "watchlist", which allows a user to store a list of products that can be checked for new recalls whenever the user chooses.
